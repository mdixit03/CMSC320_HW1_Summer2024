I am interested in CMSC320 because of how increasingly relevant Data Science is to our everyday lives. Every aspect of our digital prescence has in some way been impacted by an application of data science, and I am interested in learning about the new technology and professional fields created by data science. Moreover, I took ENGL289G in the SP2024 semester, and learning about the basics of creating an LLM and simple neural networks made me curious about where the data used for training these models comes from.
